# Morgane.dev

My personal website available at https://morgane.dev

# Deploy

on a machine with docker git clone the repo :

`git clone https://github.com/M0rganeDev/morgane.dev`

cd into it and run :

`sudo docker compose up -d`

that's about it, put `morgane.dev.nginx.conf` in `/etc/nginx/site-enabled` to use a reverse proxy
